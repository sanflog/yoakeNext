Hi, I'm **Yudai Sasaki**. This is first post.  
From today, I will write blog articles in **English** for increasing my own ability. I'm **studying English** these days. 

I would like to write about below things:

> - Anything I thought of.
> - Things happened when learning programing and English.
> - Anything.

It is important for me to keep writing this blog.

### MarkDown practice!
